Problem: Given a base and a height, write a function that returns the area of a triangle.
(Intrepid technical question)

Solution:
 function areaOfTri(base, height){
  let area = (base/2) * height;
  return area
 }

Explained:

So with this problem it was pretty straight forward. What I had to do is write a function that take in 2 parameters (base and height) then in my funtion take those parameters and include them in the area of a triangle method (area of a triangle = half the base * height). Then when the parameters are taken in the function then returns our new area . For example i called my function areaOfTri and passed in 2 aurguments (10,5), areaOfTri(10,5) you get an out put of 25 which would be the area of this triangle givin that the base is 10 and the height is 5.
